Here is the best discord bot that is made to bring discord a new economy system for all servers!

You need to go to the release, download the zip file and uncompress it to the folder you want to the bot for working.

You must have the NodeJS in your machine and run the index.js file using node.

This bot was create in a windows pc, if something doesn't work, you should re-install the dependencies using those commands on the prompt:

npm init -y

npm install discord.js dotenv better-sqlite3

npm install -D nodemon

also, create a file called: package.json

Inside this file, put that code:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev":   "nodemon index.js"
}

And now you should be able to use the bot!

But to make sure that the bot will work, you will need to create it hahaha

Go to the https://discord.com/developers/applications/

Create an application and go to the bot section, create one, configure as you like and active the funcions called Intent (every intent function need to be on)!

Now you should go to the bot, get the token by reseting it and coppying it and paste it in the file .env like that:

DISCORD_TOKEN=MTM4NzdfhyMKSIENOABUFBIR.Giakofuibert.arfetyeryerqinweirbnuetbassndiwneortbt_tCE
CLIENT_ID=1345678900012324

Like that UwU

But obviously you will need to edit with the informations of YOUR bot, not mine (the informations above are an example ._. obsviously they are not the true information of an real bot for u to use)

The initial file cames like:

DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
CLIENT_ID=BOT_ID

And you will need to change it U.U

Bot finally, you will need to go to the OAuth2 part of the bot on the site and select "bot" scope and the permissions like "send messages" etc, and copy the bot invite link that discord will generate!

You should put this link in the bot's description for everyone can use it to invite bot to their servers!

Now, the bot is in your server if you clicked on the link or put it in the web browser...

Now, you can run the bot using node js or any system that runs Java Scripts OwO

Now, use my bot instead of creating your own!

This page is only for you to help me creating things for the bot or improving the things that the bot already has! :3
